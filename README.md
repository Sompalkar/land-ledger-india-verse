## 🔐 Authentication

The project uses a custom authentication system with JWT tokens stored in localStorage. In a production environment, you would want to:

- Implement proper backend authentication with secure token handling
- Use HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- Add CSRF protection
- Implement proper password hashing with bcrypt or Argon2

## 💾 Data Storage

This version uses a simulated MongoDB implementation with localStorage. In a production environment:

- Connect to a real MongoDB Atlas instance
- Implement proper database schema validation
- Set up indexes for performance
- Implement proper error handling and connection management

## 🚀 Deployment

To deploy this project to production:

1. Build the project with `npm run build`
2. Deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to your preferred hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, AWS, etc.)
3. Set up environment variables for API keys and other sensitive information
4. Configure CORS and other security headers
5. Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

## 🔄 Future Improvements

- **Real Blockchain Integration**: Connect to Ethereum or Hyperledger for actual blockchain records
- **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket for real-time updates on property status changes
- **Mobile App**: Develop companion mobile apps for field verification and document uploads
- **Multi-language Support**: Add support for multiple Indian languages
- **Offline Support**: Add offline capabilities for rural areas with limited connectivity
- **Document OCR**: Implement Optical Character Recognition for document verification
- **GIS Integration**: Add Geographic Information System for precise property mapping
- **Smart Contract Templates**: Create templates for common property transactions
- **Advanced Analytics**: Add more advanced analytics and reporting capabilities
